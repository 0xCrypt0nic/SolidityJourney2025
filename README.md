# Solidity Journey 2025 ðŸš€

## About

This repository documents my personal journey to becoming a **professional Blockchain Developer**, specialized in **Solidity** and the **Ethereum ecosystem**.  
From **August 11, 2025** to **December 31, 2025**, I will follow a **structured and evolving learning program** built in collaboration with **ChatGPT AI**.

The goal:  
**Be fully operational for professional blockchain development projects by January 2026.**

---

## Program Overview

The program is divided into **weekly modules** with clear objectives, practical exercises, and GitHub documentation for each step.  
It covers:

- **Solidity fundamentals**
- **Ethereum smart contract development**
- **Web3 frontend integration**
- **Blockchain security best practices**
- **Advanced concepts** (ERC standards, Account Abstraction, etc.)
- **Tooling** (Hardhat, Foundry, Ethers.js, etc.)
- **Real-world projects** deployed on Ethereum testnets

This plan is **adaptive**: it evolves according to the latest updates in blockchain development and my personal progress.

## How I Work

- **4 study/practice days per week** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday)
- **7â€“10 hours per week**
- Each week: learning theory, coding exercises, documenting progress
- Repository updated **daily or weekly** with:
  - Code samples
  - Explanations & notes
  - Useful resources
  - Lessons learned

## Why This Journey?

After years of experience in **C# .NET, Node.js, SQL, and various front-end technologies**, I decided to fully specialize in **Blockchain & Web3 development**.  
This repository is my personal roadmap, portfolio, and open notebook.

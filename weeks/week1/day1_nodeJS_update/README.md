# Week 1, Day 1: Node.js Refresher 🚀 (12 August 2025)

## Overview 🌟

Kicking off my `SolidityJourney2025`, I revisited the fundamentals of Node.js to prepare for blockchain development tools like Hardhat. As a Node.js novice, I followed the fantastic [Node JS Tutorial For Beginners 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGl3f0xTl_0) by GreatStack. This 2h34 video was perfect for refreshing my skills with clear, hands-on examples. Here’s a recap of what I learned and practiced on Tuesday, 12 August 2025.

## What I Learned 📚

- **Node.js Basics** 🖥️: Discovered that Node.js is a JavaScript runtime for server-side apps, powered by Chrome’s V8 engine. It’s key for blockchain tools like Hardhat.
- **Installation** 🔧: Installed Node.js (version 18+) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and checked versions with `node -v` and `npm -v`.
- **Running Scripts** ▶️: Learned to run JavaScript files with `node filename.js`, starting with a "Hello World" script.
- **Modules** 📦: Explored CommonJS (`require`) and ES modules (`import/export`) to organize and reuse code.
- **NPM and Packages** 📲: Used `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` and installed a package (e.g., lodash) with `npm install`. Got the hang of dependency management.
- **HTTP Server** 🌐: Built a simple server using the `http` module to handle requests, testing it in a browser.
- **Events Emitters** ⏳: Learned how to use events emitters from "events" package (create, remove, handling error).

## Practice 🛠️

- Created and ran a "Hello World" script to test Node.js.
- Set up a project with `npm init` and experimented with a package like lodash.
- Built a basic HTTP server that responds with a message when accessed.
- Took notes on key concepts (modules, npm, events) to reinforce learning.

## Next Steps 🔜

This Node.js refresher sets the foundation for blockchain development. Over the next two days, I’ll dive into Solidity basics with CryptoZombies and set up Hardhat and MetaMask to start building smart contracts. Stay tuned! 🌐

# Week 1, Day 2: Solidity Basics and Hardhat Setup (16 August 2025)

**Objective**: Dive into the fundamentals of Solidity using an interactive learning platform and set up a development environment with Hardhat and MetaMask to prepare for Ethereum smart contract development. This day is designed for beginners in Node.js and Solidity, with step-by-step guidance to ensure success.

**Total Estimated Time**: 4 hours (split into morning and afternoon sessions)  
**Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge (C#, JavaScript), a recent Node.js refresher (completed on 12 August 2025), and a GitHub repository (`SolidityJourney2025`). A computer with a browser (for CryptoZombies) and a terminal (for Hardhat) is required.  
**Tools Needed**: Node.js (version 18+), Hardhat, MetaMask, GitHub account.  
**Note**: This detailed plan is tailored for a novice, with simplified tasks, beginner-friendly resources, and clear instructions to build confidence.

## First Session - Introduction to Solidity Basics

**Goal**: Learn the core concepts of Solidity through interactive exercises, focusing on smart contract structure and basic data types.

### Tasks

1. **Access CryptoZombies (5 min)**:

   - Go to [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) and create an account (or log in if already created).
   - Navigate to the "Solidity Basics" course and start Lesson 1.
   - Tip: Use Chrome for the best experience, and keep a notepad or text editor open for notes.

2. **Complete Lesson 1: Introduction to Smart Contracts (45 min)**:

   - Follow Lesson 1, which covers:
     - **Pragma**: The `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` directive to specify the Solidity version.
     - **Contract Structure**: How to define a contract (e.g., `contract MyContract {}`).
     - **Functions**: Writing basic functions.
   - Complete the interactive coding exercises in the browser (e.g., creating a simple contract).
   - Expected outcome: Understand what a smart contract is and write a basic one in CryptoZombies.

3. **Complete Lesson 2: Data Types and State Variables (45 min)**:

   - Follow Lesson 2, focusing on:
     - **Data Types**: `uint` (unsigned integers), `string`, `address`.
     - **State Variables**: Variables stored on the blockchain (e.g., `uint myNumber = 42;`).
   - Complete the exercises, which involve creating variables and simple functions to manipulate them.
   - Expected outcome: Create a contract with state variables and understand their role.

4. **Take Notes in Markdown (5 min)**:
   - Open a text editor (e.g., VS Code) and create `/week1/notes/solidity-basics.md` in your `SolidityJourney2025` repository.
   - Write brief notes (in English for GitHub visibility):
     - What is a smart contract? (A program stored on the blockchain, executed automatically.)
     - Key differences with C# (e.g., no classes, blockchain storage, static typing).
     - Examples of data types and their syntax (e.g., `uint`, `string`).
   - Example note structure:
     ```
     # Solidity Basics Notes
     - **Smart Contract**: Code on the blockchain, runs when called.
     - **Data Types**: `uint` for numbers, `string` for text, `address` for Ethereum accounts.
     - **Compared to C#**: No object-oriented classes, focused on blockchain state.
     ```

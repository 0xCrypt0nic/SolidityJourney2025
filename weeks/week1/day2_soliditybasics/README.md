# Week 1, Day 2: Solidity Basics and Hardhat Setup (16 August 2025)

**Objective**: Dive into the fundamentals of Solidity using an interactive learning platform and set up a development environment with Hardhat and MetaMask to prepare for Ethereum smart contract development. This day is designed for beginners in Node.js and Solidity, with step-by-step guidance to ensure success.

**Total Estimated Time**: 4 hours (split into morning and afternoon sessions)  
**Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge (C#, JavaScript), a recent Node.js refresher (completed on 12 August 2025), and a GitHub repository (`SolidityJourney2025`). A computer with a browser (for CryptoZombies) and a terminal (for Hardhat) is required.  
**Tools Needed**: Node.js (version 18+), Hardhat, MetaMask, GitHub account.  
**Note**: This detailed plan is tailored for a novice, with simplified tasks, beginner-friendly resources, and clear instructions to build confidence.

## Morning Session: 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM (2 hours) - Introduction to Solidity Basics

**Goal**: Learn the core concepts of Solidity through interactive exercises, focusing on smart contract structure and basic data types.

### Tasks

1. **Access CryptoZombies (5 min)**:

   - Go to [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) and create an account (or log in if already created).
   - Navigate to the "Solidity Basics" course and start Lesson 1.
   - Tip: Use Chrome for the best experience, and keep a notepad or text editor open for notes.

2. **Complete Lesson 1: Introduction to Smart Contracts (45 min)**:
   - Follow Lesson 1, which covers:
     - **Pragma**: The `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` directive to specify the Solidity version.
     - **Contract Structure**: How to define a contract (e.g., `contract MyContract {}`).
     - **Functions**: Writing basic functions (e.g., `function sayHello() public returns (string memory)`).
   - Complete the interactive coding exercises in the browser (e.g., creating a simple contract).
   - Expected outcome: Understand what a smart contract is and write a basic one in CryptoZombies.

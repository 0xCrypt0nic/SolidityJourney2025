# Week 1, Day 3: First Smart Contract and Solidity Visibility üìù

**Objective**: Write and deploy a simple smart contract using Remix IDE and learn about Solidity data types and visibility modifiers. This day builds on my Node.js and Solidity basics as a beginner, preparing me to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and understand key Solidity concepts.

**Total Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge (C#, JavaScript), Node.js refresher (Day 1), Solidity basics (Day 2 morning), and Hardhat/MetaMask setup (Day 2). A computer with a browser (for Remix) and MetaMask installed with test ETH on Sepolia.
**Tools Needed**: Remix IDE, MetaMask, GitHub account, Sepolia test network.  
**Note**: This plan is tailored for a Solidity novice, with detailed steps, beginner-friendly resources, and troubleshooting tips to ensure success.

## Session 1 - First Smart Contract with Remix

**Goal**: Write, compile, and deploy a simple smart contract on the Sepolia test network using Remix IDE, learning the basics of contract interaction.

### Tasks

1.  **Open Remix IDE**:

    - Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended).
    - Ensure MetaMask is installed and connected to the Sepolia test network with test ETH (from Day 2).
    - Create a new file in Remix: Click the "File Explorer" tab, then "Create New File" and name it `Counter.sol`.

2.  **Write the Counter Smart Contract**:

    - Copy and paste the following Solidity code into `Counter.sol`:

      // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
      pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

      contract Counter {
      uint256 public count;

          function increment() public {
              count += 1;
          }

          function decrement() public {
              count -= 1;
          }

          function getCount() public view returns (uint256) {
              return count;
          }

      }

    - Understand the code:
      - `uint256 public count`: A state variable to store a number on the blockchain.
      - `increment()`: Increases `count` by 1.
      - `decrement()`: Decreases `count` by 1.
      - `getCount()`: Returns the current `count` value without modifying the blockchain (`view`).
    - Tip: Save the file frequently (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S).

3.  **Compile the Contract**:

    - Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab in Remix (left sidebar, hammer icon).
    - Select compiler version `0.8.x` (matching the `pragma` in the code).
    - Click "Compile Counter.sol".
    - Check for a green checkmark indicating successful compilation. If errors occur, ensure the code is exact or check for typos.

4.  **Deploy the Contract on Sepolia**:

    - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (left sidebar, play icon).
    - In the "Environment" dropdown, select "Injected Provider - MetaMask".
    - MetaMask should prompt you to connect; select your Sepolia wallet.
    - Ensure you have at least 0.01 ETH on Sepolia.
    - Select `Counter` in the contract dropdown and click "Deploy".
    - Approve the transaction in MetaMask (gas fees apply, paid in test ETH).
    - Once deployed, find the contract address in Remix‚Äôs "Deployed Contracts" section.
    - Test the contract:
      - Click `increment` and approve in MetaMask (check if `count` increases).
      - Click `decrement` and verify the change.
      - Call `getCount` (no gas fee, as it‚Äôs `view`) to see the current `count`.
    - Take a screenshot of the deployment (Remix‚Äôs "Deployed Contracts" section) or MetaMask transaction confirmation.

## Session 2 - Understanding Solidity Types and Visibility

**Goal**: Learn about Solidity data types and visibility modifiers through documentation and a simple contract.

### Tasks

1. **Read Solidity Documentation**:

   - Open the [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) in your browser.
   - Read the **Types** section ([https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html)):
     - Focus on `uint` (unsigned integers), `address` (Ethereum addresses), and `string` (text).
     - Note: `uint` is used for numbers (e.g., `uint256 myNumber = 100;`), `address` for wallet/contract addresses, and `string` for text data.
   - Read the **Visibility and Getters** section ([https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#visibility-and-getters](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#visibility-and-getters)):
     - Understand visibility modifiers: `public` (accessible everywhere), `private` (only within the contract).
     - Example: A `public` variable auto-generates a getter function; `private` restricts access.
   - Take brief notes in a text editor (e.g., VS Code) for the next step.

2. **Create a Visibility Test Contract**:

   - In Remix, create a new file `VisibilityTest.sol`:

     ```
     // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
     pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

     contract VisibilityTest {
         uint256 public publicVar = 1;
         uint256 private privateVar = 2;

         function setPrivateVar(uint256 _value) public {
             privateVar = _value;
         }

         function getPrivateVar() public view returns (uint256) {
             return privateVar;
         }
     }
     ```

   - Understand the code:
     - `publicVar`: Accessible externally, auto-generates a getter.
     - `privateVar`: Only accessible within the contract, but `getPrivateVar` allows controlled access.
   - Compile the contract in Remix (Solidity Compiler tab, version 0.8.x).
   - Deploy on Sepolia (same steps as `Counter.sol`).
   - Test in Remix:
     - Call `publicVar` directly (returns 1).
     - Try accessing `privateVar` directly (should fail due to `private`).
     - Call `setPrivateVar(5)` and `getPrivateVar` to confirm the value updates to 3.

# Week 2 Program: Intermediate Solidity and First Project

**Objective**: Build on Week 1â€™s foundations by learning intermediate Solidity concepts (structs, mappings, events) and creating a simple voting smart contract with tests.

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
**Prerequisites**: Completion of Week 1 (Node.js refresher, Solidity basics, Hardhat/MetaMask setup, Remix deployment). A computer with Node.js (version 18+), Hardhat, MetaMask, Remix IDE, and a GitHub repository (`SolidityJourney2025`).  
**Tools Needed**: Hardhat, Remix IDE, MetaMask, Sepolia test network, GitHub, VS Code (recommended).  
**Note**: Each day includes practical tasks, beginner-friendly resources, and GitHub updates to maintain an engaging portfolio.

## Day 1: Structs, Arrays, and Mappings

**Objective**: Learn structs and mappings in Solidity to handle complex data, using CryptoZombies and Remix for practice.

**Resources**:

- [CryptoZombies - Lesson 3](https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/3) (structs/arrays).
- [CryptoZombies - Lesson 4](https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/4) (mappings).
- [Solidity - Types](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html).

## Day 2: Events and Simple Voting Contract

**Objective**: Understand Solidity events and build a basic voting smart contract combining structs and mappings.

**Resources**:

- [Solidity - Events](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#events).
- [Solidity by Example - Voting](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/voting/).
- [Remix IDE - Deploy](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create_deploy.html).

## Day 3: Testing and Project Wrap-Up

**Objective**: Write unit tests for the voting contract using Hardhat and finalize the Week 2 project.

**Resources**:

- [Hardhat - Testing Contracts](https://v2.hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/test-contracts).
- [Mocha Docs](https://mochajs.org/) (basic overview).

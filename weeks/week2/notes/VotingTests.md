## Overview üìù

Creating a hardhat project and copy our Voting contract in contract folder.
Write a full test [Voting-test.ts](../day3/VotingProject/test/Voting-test.ts) with TypeScript, I use loadFixture to deploy the contract.

First time I ran tests, they failed, because I made an error on constructor call of Voting contract.

Second time, was ok.
